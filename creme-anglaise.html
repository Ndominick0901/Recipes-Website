    <h1>Creme Anglaise</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(6) Cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>(6) Cups Half-an-Half</li>
        <li>(1) Cup Sugar</li>
        <li>(3) Vanilla Beans</li>
        <li>(30) Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>(2) Cups Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring Heavy Cream, Half-an-Half, (1) Cup of Sugar, and scraped Vanilla bean pulp with pod to a boil.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with ice cubes and water and set a smaller bowl inside.</li>
        <li>Whisk yolks and remaining sugar together in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Continue whisking and add hot liquid to the saucepan in a slow stream.  When yolks are warm, add the rest of the liquid in a more steady stream.  Remove the vanilla pod and return the liquid to the burner and switch to continuous stirring with a spatula.  When the liquid is lightened in color (very pale) take the spatula out of the liquid and run your finger through the center of the liquid which coats the spatula.  You will know it is finished if the liquid doesn't run back through the track your finger has made.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and pour through a fine mesh strainer into the container that you have resting in the ice bath.  Continue to stir until the liquid has cooled completely.</li>
    </ol>
