<h1>Creamy Caesar Dressing</h1>
<img src="./images/caesar.png" alt="A Creamy Caesar Dressing" style="width:325px;height:500px;">
<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Ceasar Dressing has been iterated upon for many years and can will adapt to be enjoyed year round.  It is extremely flexible, and as long as you keep the base recipe the same it can be updated to fit whatever season you are experiencing.  For instance, in the summer I will add fresh basil, reduce the red wine vinegar, and make up the liquid with fresh lemon juice for a more refreshing dressing!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(8) Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>(2) Whole Eggs</li>
